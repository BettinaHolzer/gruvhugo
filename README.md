## Installation
Adding theme as a sub-module is by the most efficient way to do things in my opinion. If you wish to use the theme as it is then all you need to do add the sub-module but if you wish to modify and maintain your own fork of the theme then make the necessary changes to the git remotes as you see fit.

``` sh
$ git submodule add https://gitlab.com/avron/gruvhugo.git
```
